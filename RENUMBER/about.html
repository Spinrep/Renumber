        <h1>Memocode Studio</h1>
        
        <p>
            We are Santiago and Mauricio, two young developers taking our first steps in the world of programming and web development. Our team, <span class="studio-name">Memocode Studio</span>, was born with the idea of creating something fun that also exercises the mind. This is how our first project emerges, an online game called Renumber, developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front end, and Java as the back end language.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Renumber is a numerical memory game in which the player must remember sequences of numbers that appear briefly on the screen. As you progress, the difficulty grows: the numbers are longer, time is reduced and attention becomes essential. Behind this simple concept are many hours of learning, testing and corrections, which have taught us about logic, interface design, client-server communication, and real-time data management.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            More than a simple game, Renumber symbolizes the beginning of our journey as programmers. It is the first step of many projects to come. At <span class="studio-name">Memocode Studio</span> we want to continue growing, creating interactive experiences that combine creativity, technology and learning. This is just the beginning.
